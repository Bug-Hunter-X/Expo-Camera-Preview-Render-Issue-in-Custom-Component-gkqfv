This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom camera component.  The preview doesn't render correctly, sometimes showing a black screen or a distorted image. This is often due to incorrect prop usage or lifecycle management within the custom camera component.  Specifically, the `onCameraReady` callback might not be used effectively to ensure the camera is properly initialized before trying to access its properties or functions.
